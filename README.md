# Seamless Iframes: The future, today!

This is a talk I gave at several conferences during 2012:

* [Gotham JS](http://gothamjs.com) in NYC
* [HTML5DevConf](http://html5devconf.com/) in San Francisco ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQCm8VYn93Y))
* [JS.everywhere](http://jseverywhere.eu/) in Paris, France ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLp2tO3lQYs))

### Why don't the slides w/ live seamless examples work?

Good question!

These slides were presented during a short window during which Chrome had had experimental support for seamless (Chrome 20 - 26). Unfortunately, Chrome pulled support for seamless in Chrome 27, and as of late 2014, [not a single browser supports seamless](http://caniuse.com/#feat=iframe-seamless).

If you really, really wanted to, you could download an old version of Chrome with which to read the slides. But Google doesn't provide old versions themselves, so you need to use a 3rd-party mirror. This is probably unsafe, so I wouldn't recommend it.

If you want to see how it worked, I recommend watching one of the video recordings linked above.


### Who are you again?
